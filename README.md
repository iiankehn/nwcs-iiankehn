# iiankehn.com Website Project
This is the iiankehn.com Website Project. This project is designed to aid in the development of the website and its projects. While the code is publicly available, it is not really intended for forking for personal use, and is set up in a way to prevent such actions. 

At the current stage in development, we are asking that if you have suggestions or issues, that you use the Issues section on this project and submit feedback that way. All Pull, Push, and Fork requests outside of the development team will be rejected for security purposes. While we appreciate the notion of code suggestions, we generally don't intend to run the project that way. 

## Submitting feedback
Feedback about site functions, features, bugs or general issues help aid in development in the website. Please use the Issue tracker provided by GitHub and provide a detailed account of the feature, bug, or issue you are having. We will review the feedback and implement changes accoedingly.

## Copyrighted Content
This website, its code, and projects are subject to copyright law unless otherwise noted. Some code may contain elements from other projects and they will be credited according to fair use laws in the United States. We do not use others code without giving them credit.
